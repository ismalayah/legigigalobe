His love of myths is passed on to him from his mother Mabel (<a href=#>Laura Donnelly</a>), who regales her two sons with stories of dragons and knights and gold. When Mabel dies, Ronald and his brother are orphaned, and become wards of Father Francis Morgan (<a href=#>Colm Meaney</a>), who places them in a boarding house for children in similar circumstances. After a bumpy start at school, Ronald finds himself with three best friends, Christopher Wiseman (Ty Tennant), Robert Gilson (Albie Marber) and Geoffrey Bache Smith (Adam Bregman). They gather at Barrows after school and talk about their artistic pursuits, calling themselves the T.C.B.S. (Tea Club, Barrovian Society). This is the formation of Tolkien's cherished "fellowship," underlined by sweeping music in case you missed the connection. The young actors create a believable bond, as do the group of older actors who portray them once they reach college college (<a href=#>Nicholas Hoult</a>, with intense blue eyes and sharp cheekbones, as Tolkien, <a href=#>Anthony Boyle</a> as Geoffrey, <a href=#>Tom Glynn-Carney</a> as Christopher, and <a href=#>Patrick Gibson</a> as Robert).</p><p data-children-count=0>Since these sequences are intercut with Tolkien a couple of years down the road, staggering through the trenches in France looking for Geoffrey through mounds of dead bodies, the burgeoning friendship of the boys has a feeling of "the doomed" about it. In the preface to the second edition of The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien wrote, "One has indeed personally to come under the shadow of war to feel fully its oppression; but as the years go by it seems now often forgotten that to be caught in youth by 1914 was no less hideous an experience than to be involved in 1939 and the following years. By 1918 all but one of my close friends were dead." "Tolkien" captures this really well.</p><p data-children-count=0>Tolkien's romance with Edith Bratt (<a href=#>Lily Collins</a>), another orphan living at the boarding house, leads to one of the highlights in the film, a long scene where the two converse about language, arguing about meaning vs. sound. This scene loops in the famous "cellar door" concept, beloved by Tolkien ("cellar door" is beautiful to say and hear, separated entirely from what it means). The script really digs into "cellar door," giving Edith's character some "oomph" in the process, while also managing to be a coiled-up late-Victorian-era love scene, the passionate meeting of two minds. The scene doesn't feel like a box being checked off towards a predestined result. It's really about something. Later, in another fun sequence, Edith introduces Tolkien to Wagner's "Ring Cycle" in an extremely unconventional way, providing some context to another one of Tolkien's inspirations. <a href=#>Derek Jacobi</a> shows up as Joseph Wright, the eccentric philology professor at Oxford who takes Tolkien under his wing, spouting a long monologue about the word "oak." "Tolkien" is a movie about people who think about things. You buy it.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tpqWjmZq7bn6PanA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./brie-larson-stunned-after-meeting-harrison-ford-with-the-marvels-cast.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Brie Larson stunned after meeting Harrison Ford with The Marvels cast</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./shaan-shahid-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-570396-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Shaan Shahid Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Lauren Miller Rogen movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-are-the-twin-sisters-who-swapped-identities-after-a-deadly-amish-buggy-crash.html>Who are the twin sisters who swapped identities after a deadly Amish buggy crash?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-confirmed-doctor-who-spin-off-shows-currently-in-production.html>All confirmed Doctor Who spin-off shows currently in production</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ice-beam-move.html>Ice Beam (move) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kirsten-rosenberg-oliver-tree-girlfriend-relation.html>Is Kirsten Rosenberg, Oliver Tree Girlfriend?
