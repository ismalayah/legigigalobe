Still, Glatter claimed that filming the killing scene in Love & Death was “the most profoundly upsetting thing” she has ever captured:</p><p>“Filming that scene in the laundry room was the most intense experience I ever had as a director. I’ve done a lot of action. I’ve blown up a lot of s***. I have killed characters in horrifying ways and this scene with two women inside a laundry room was the most profoundly upsetting thing I’ve ever directed.”</p><p data-characters=339 data-current-count=682 data-injectable=true>Further into the discussion, it was revealed that before shooting that particular scene Glatter storyboarded each moment in the laundry room scene to ensure that no mistakes are made. Glatter would explain that it was difficult to film that scene because it was a “very small space,” and there was fake blood almost everywhere:</p><p>“We had multiple cameras though of course we were in a very small space. There was lots of blood. It was really challenging. It was a laundry room, so choreographing the scene within that given what was going on it was a challenge… I think it went to the drama of it because being in such a small space there’s no place to go I think made more intense. It was almost like this bottled up energy that had no release.”</p><p data-characters=58 data-current-count=58 data-injectable=false>All episodes of Love & Death is now streaming on Max.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TBqbGMpqasrF2lv7Cyzq6lnaSpYsKxv8Stq6Kml2LBqbXNoGSirpVisrex0WaboqqVmMGmsIylpq%2BdXZa7pXnDnpitoF2ZtrOxwq2mq2Wfo3q1tMCtZKyblaOybsPIrZ9mnZyex6KuxK2fZqecqLKvew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-jovanna-burke-everything-about-the-canadian-actress.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Jovanna Burke?
