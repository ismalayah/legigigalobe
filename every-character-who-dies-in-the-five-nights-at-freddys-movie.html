However, considering <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the movie is PG-13</a>, I didn’t expect any over-the-top gory death scenes.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=176 data-current-count=483 data-injectable=true>That doesn’t mean they weren’t enjoyable to watch, though! Here’s a look at all the characters who die in the&nbsp;Five Nights at Freddy’s&nbsp;movie, in order.</p><h2 id=h-unknown-security-guard data-injectable=false>Unknown security guard</h2><p data-characters=302 data-current-count=302 data-injectable=false>The first character to bite the bullet is an unknown security guard working the night shift at the defunct Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza. In the opening scene, we see him getting chased through the building’s air ducts and dark corridors. Based on its shadow, it appears Foxy is chasing him.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=370 data-current-count=672 data-injectable=true>When the security guard gets caught, viewers find him strapped to a chair. An overhauled Freddy animatronic head better suited for the&nbsp;Saw&nbsp;franchise is shown closing in on his face before the screen cuts away with nothing but his screams to go off of. Even though the death isn’t shown on screen, it’s assumed that the security guard is dead.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-attempted-robbery-victims data-injectable=false>Attempted robbery victims&nbsp;</h2><p data-characters=292 data-current-count=292 data-injectable=false>In a desperate attempt to get custody of Abby (played by Piper Rubio), her Aunt Jane convinces her babysitter, Max, to search the house and dig up dirt on Abby’s brother and legal guardian, Mike (played by Josh Hutcherson). When she can’t find anything, they turn to plan B.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=286 data-current-count=578 data-injectable=true>Along with her brother Jeff and their two friends, they decide to rob Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza. As the lone security guard, they hope Mike will get fired for not preventing the robbery, ensuring Aunt Jane would get custody. What ensues, however, is an absolute slaughter fest.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-carl-joseph-poliquin data-injectable=false>Carl (Joseph Poliquin)</h2><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=331 data-injectable=false>Carl was the first of the burglars to kick the bucket. While ransacking the kitchen, he hears a noise coming from an industrial-sized refrigerator. When he opens the door, he finds Chica’s cupcake, AKA Carl the Cupcake, sitting there. After a brief appearance by Chica, Carl’s face gets chewed off by the cupcake.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/carl_the_cupcake_fnaf.png><h2 id=h-hank-christian-stokes data-injectable=false>Hank (Christian Stokes)</h2><p data-characters=223 data-current-count=223 data-injectable=false>After catching a glimpse of Carl’s demise, Hank takes a run for it. Unfortunately, he hides in the closet where Bonnie is hanging out, and his off-screen murder is solidified by his bloody handprint on the door.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-jeff-david-lind data-injectable=false>Jeff (David Lind)</h2><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=594 data-injectable=true>Max’s brother, Jeff, witnesses his friend’s death and hides in the security office. While watching the security cameras, he sees Chica send her cupcake through the air ducts in his direction. It turns out to be a distraction, however, intended to get him to leave the office. When he does, Foxy is waiting for him, resulting in another off-screen death.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-max-kat-conner-sterling data-injectable=false>Max (Kat Conner Sterling)</h2><p data-characters=365 data-current-count=365 data-injectable=false>As the getaway driver, Abby’s babysitter Max grew impatient and ultimately went inside Freddy’s. There, she finds a child who lures her deeper into the abandoned restaurant. Eventually, the child beckons her from inside a Freddy animatronic. When she stands on a chair to peek inside, she unintentionally helps them recreate the bite of ’87.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Max_death_FNAF.png><h2 id=h-aunt-jane-mary-stuart-masterson data-injectable=false>Aunt Jane (Mary Stuart Masterson)</h2><p data-characters=434 data-current-count=434 data-injectable=true>Later in the film, Freddy stops by Abby’s house to pick her up and bring her to Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza. It’s unknown how the animatronic got there in the first place, but they end up taking a cab back to the restaurant. As Abby walks out the door with him, she notices her aunt lying on the floor. The ghost boy inside of Freddy plays it off like she’s sleeping, but it’s pretty clear she got killed off.</p><h2 id=h-vanessa-elizabeth-lail data-injectable=false>Vanessa (Elizabeth Lail)</h2><p data-characters=421 data-current-count=421 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Local police officer Vanessa</a> frequently visits Mike during his overnight shifts at Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza. While she comes off nice at first, it quickly becomes apparent that she knows much more than she’s letting on. After she reveals her ties to the restaurant and the man responsible for the disappearance of several children in the eighties, she refuses to help Mike save Abby from the animatronics.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=329 data-current-count=329 data-injectable=false>Eventually, Vanessa has a change of heart and shows up just in time to lend a hand. Unfortunately, she gets stabbed in the stomach by William Afton, who also happens to be her father. She’s shown in a coma at the end of the film, so it’s still possible she’ll survive and make an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">appearance in the sequel</a>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/William_Afton_springtrap_FNAF.png><h2 id=h-william-afton-matthew-lillard data-injectable=false>William Afton (Matthew Lillard)</h2><p data-characters=532 data-current-count=532 data-injectable=true>The best death scene in the&nbsp;Five Nights at Freddy’s&nbsp;film has to be the last one. Matthew Lillard portrays child murderer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">William Afton</a>, who controls the ghosts of the kids he killed from the inside of an old Golden Bonnie springlock suit. After Mike and Abby figure out how to turn the animatronics against Afton, they activate the springs, killing him inside the Bonnie suit. Anyone familiar with the FNAF games or the lore undoubtedly recognized this moment as Afton’s transition into Springtrap.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=79 data-current-count=79 data-injectable=false>Catch&nbsp;Five Nights at Freddy’s&nbsp;now in theaters or streaming on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Peacock</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJonK%2Bdoq56pLTAq5icrJWneri0zmabop2jYravedOhnGaemauybrrIoJ%2Btq12WwW6y0Z6bnbGjYrqwwsieZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jacobs-ladder-movie-review-2019.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jacob's Ladder movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2019)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./all-modern-doctor-who-companions-from-nuwho-ranked-worst-to-best.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>All modern Doctor Who companions from NuWho, ranked worst to best</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Lauren Miller Rogen movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-are-the-twin-sisters-who-swapped-identities-after-a-deadly-amish-buggy-crash.html>Who are the twin sisters who swapped identities after a deadly Amish buggy crash?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-confirmed-doctor-who-spin-off-shows-currently-in-production.html>All confirmed Doctor Who spin-off shows currently in production</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ice-beam-move.html>Ice Beam (move) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kirsten-rosenberg-oliver-tree-girlfriend-relation.html>Is Kirsten Rosenberg, Oliver Tree Girlfriend?
