He is one of the few animators making features outside the Disney umbrella; he worked for Disney from 1972 to 1979 ("The Rescuers" was largely his) before breaking away to form his own group.</p><p>His credits since include "<a href=#>The Secret of NIMH</a>," "<a href=#>An American Tail</a>," "<a href=#>The Land Before Time</a>," "All Dogs Go to Heaven" and "Rock-a-Doodle." I liked the lush animated colors of "Dogs" and the inventive landscape of "Land," which was about orphaned dinosaurs, but in general Bluth's animation is better than his story sense, and that's the case with "Thumbelina." Here is a girl character who is vapid, innocuous and hapless. She needs lessons in pluck from the Little Mermaid. Born in the bud of a flower (Georgia O'Keeffe would have liked that touch), she spends her early years in loneliness, because there don't seem to be any boys the size of a thumb. Then, just as she meets Prince Charming, she's spirited away by the mean Mrs. Toad, as a potential spouse for one of the junior toads. This sets in motion a series of picaresque adventures, including the attempts by a field mouse (with Carol Channing's voice) to fix her up with a rich mole (<a href=#>John Hurt</a>).</p><p>I didn't much care, for two reasons: Thumbelina's woe-is-me act got old real fast, and I couldn't care less about her matrimonial prospects. Nor was I much cheered by the eventual arrival of the Prince Charming, who doesn't turn up in time to prevent the singing of several romantic dirges by <a href=#>Barry Manilow</a>. The movie's passive heroine leads to a generally low energy level, and the supporting characters arrive onscreen like game old vaudevillians, doing their song and dance and making way for the next act.</p><p>Bluth originally left Disney because he found the studio's animation efforts moribund. The irony is that his own films now more closely resemble the Disney of the 1970s than those from the current studio. With "<a href=#>The Little Mermaid</a>," "<a href=#>Beauty and the Beast</a>" and "<a href=#>Aladdin</a>," Disney has not only reached a new creative level, but is obviously aiming at a true general audience; the stories, music and action in the new Disney features are entertaining for adults, not just children. It is difficult to imagine anyone over the age of 12 finding much to enjoy in "Thumbelina."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46hmKerXZi1s7XSraCapl2Wu6Wx0aycp6tdqbW2ucGeo6KmkWJ%2BeoWT</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./krystal-klei-height-weight-net-worth-age-wiki-who-instagram-biography-36940-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Krystal Klei Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Wiki, Who, Instagram, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./durek-verrett-net-worth-meet-shaman-who-is-engaged-to-princess-martha-louise-of-norway.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Durek Verrett Net Worth: Meet Shaman Who Is Engaged To Princess Martha Louise Of Norway</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Lauren Miller Rogen movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-are-the-twin-sisters-who-swapped-identities-after-a-deadly-amish-buggy-crash.html>Who are the twin sisters who swapped identities after a deadly Amish buggy crash?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-confirmed-doctor-who-spin-off-shows-currently-in-production.html>All confirmed Doctor Who spin-off shows currently in production</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ice-beam-move.html>Ice Beam (move) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kirsten-rosenberg-oliver-tree-girlfriend-relation.html>Is Kirsten Rosenberg, Oliver Tree Girlfriend?
