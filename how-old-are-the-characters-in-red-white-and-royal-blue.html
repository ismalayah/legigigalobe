Principal photography took place between June and August 2022 in England.</p><p>The film follows the star-crossed, secret romance between the Prince of England, Henry, and the son of the President of the United States, Alex.</p><p>In the movie, the long-time rivalry between the First Son of the United States and the Prince of England transforms into romance as they manage a public relations crisis after a heated disagreement.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=red-white-and-royal-blue-characters-ages></span>Red White And Royal Blue Characters Ages<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The characters ages in Red White and Royal Blue are Alex Claremont Diaz (23) and Prince Henry (24). Alex and Henry are the lead characters of the movie.</p><p>Alex’s zodiac sign is Aries and his birthday is in late March, approximately three weeks after Henry’s. He is the beloved son of President Ellen Claremont and his wife, Senator Oscar Diaz.</p><p>He is a part of the White House trio with his elder sister June Claremont-Diaz and Nora Holleran, the granddaughter of Vice President Mike Holleran.</p><p>Like his parents, he shares a keen interest in politics and has a sharp, witty attitude. His deep care for his community sets the scene for a clash with Prince Henry when they first meet.</p><figure></figure><p>Henry, the spare to the British royal throne, is third in the line of succession after his mother, Princess Catherine, his elder brother Prince Philip, and before his sister, Princess Beatrice.</p><p>Devoted to representing his country, he approaches his responsibilities with a serious demeanor that might cause him to appear cold. However, he also has a softer side that he shows to Alex later on.</p><p>In addition to Alex and Henry, the film showcases several other pivotal characters. Let’s delve into a glimpse of these individuals.</p><ul><li>Senator Oscar Diaz -Alex’s father</li><li>Ellen Claremont -Alex’s mother and the first female president of the US- In the movie, she was 27 when she was elected to the state legislature</li><li>Zahra Bankston -the Deputy Chief of Staff of Ellen Claremont- She has been working with Ellen since around 2003 when Alex was just five</li><li>Nora Holleran -22 years old granddaughter of the Vice President of the United States</li><li>Princess Beatrice -Prince Henry’s younger sister- She is in her early 20s</li><li>Percy Okonjo -Prince Henry’s best friend</li><li>Shaan Shrivastava -Prince Henry’s equerry</li><li>Amy -Secret Service Agent</li></ul><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=alex-claremont-diaz></span>Alex Claremont-Diaz<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><figure></figure><p>Red White and Royal Blue Alex age is 23 years old.

He aspires to become a senator, driven by his desire to create a meaningful and positive impact.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=prince-henry></span>Prince Henry<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><figure></figure><p>Red White and Royal Blue Prince Henry age is 24 years old. He was born on March 12, 1997, to Princess Catherine and Arthur Fox.</p><p>In the book, he is the third youngest after Prince Philip and Princess Beatrice, but in the film, he is older than Beatrice.</p><p>Torn between his brother’s conventional royal responsibilities and his sister’s rebellious stance on the monarchy, Henry’s romance with Alex aids his self-discovery.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=red-white-and-royal-blue-cast-ages></span>Red White and Royal Blue Cast Ages<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Red White and Royal Blue cast ages are Taylor Zakhar Perez (31) and Nicholas Galitzine (28).

This indicates that it is suitabille for viewers aged 12 and older. However, the rom-com doesn’t shy away from showing adult content.</p><p>The Prime Video content advisory section reads that the movie contains nudity, alcohol use, smoking, foul language, and adult content.</p><p>As the film is released exclusively on streaming platforms and did not have a theatrical run in UK cinemas, its rating is determined by Prime Video rather than by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC).</p><p>However, it’s worth noting that in&nbsp;March of this year, both organizations declared an “enhanced collaboration.”</p><p>Interestingly, the movie has been given an R-rating by the Motion Pictures Association in the United States, indicating that viewers under the age of 17 should only watch it when accompanied by an adult.</p><figure></figure><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-is-red-white-and-royal-blue-rated-r></span>Why is Red White and Royal Blue rated R?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Red White and Royal Blue is rated R because of its inclusion of strong language, certain mature themes, and instances of partial nudity.</p><p>In light of these elements, parents are strongly encouraged to consider this rating when making viewing decisions for their children.</p><p>Speaking to Attitude, director&nbsp;Matthew Lopez&nbsp;shared, “Part of me was surprised at the R-rating, and part of me wasn’t”.</p><p>“I question if it had been a man and a woman, would we have got an R-rating for that scene? More importantly, if it had been a scene about violence, instead of love, would it have got an R rating or a PG 13 rating?” he added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKCfrHqwuMNmmKudXam1pnnCoZirmZOpsrO%2FjKKlZqqVmXq4tMitnGaZnpl6s7vYmqNmmpyqsnA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./colorfulkoala-leggings-sale-amazon.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>These $8 Butt-Lifting Leggings Are Butter-Soft, Per Amazon Shoppers</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./all-truth-of-sylvester-stallones-daughter-sistine-stallone-544372-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>All Truth Of Sylvester Stallones Daughter Sistine Stallone</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Lauren Miller Rogen movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-are-the-twin-sisters-who-swapped-identities-after-a-deadly-amish-buggy-crash.html>Who are the twin sisters who swapped identities after a deadly Amish buggy crash?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-confirmed-doctor-who-spin-off-shows-currently-in-production.html>All confirmed Doctor Who spin-off shows currently in production</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ice-beam-move.html>Ice Beam (move) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kirsten-rosenberg-oliver-tree-girlfriend-relation.html>Is Kirsten Rosenberg, Oliver Tree Girlfriend?
