What makes Marie's story extraordinary is that she discovered corruption in the parole system, and she blew the whistle on the grafters. As a result of her testimony, a Tennessee governor and other officials were sentenced to the very prisons they sought to control.</p><p>And Marie emerged as a heroine, although not without some dicey moments when it looked as if the governor's powerful cronies would be able to paint her as a heavy drinker who fudged on her expense accounts.</p><p>Marie's story falls within a fairly new tradition in American movies, of the humble young woman with pluck, who struggles against the system and makes a stand for what she believes in. The stars of the genre are <a href=#>Sally Field</a> ("Norma Rae," "<a href=#>Places in the Heart</a>"), <a href=#>Jessica Lange</a>&nbsp;("<a href=#>Country</a>") and, of course, <a href=#>Sissy Spacek</a>, who can add "Marie" to a list that includes "<a href=#>Coal Miner's Daughter</a>," "<a href=#>Raggedy Man</a>," "<a href=#>Missing</a>" and "<a href=#>The River</a>." Marie Ragghianti is the sort of character we are not surprised to find Spacek playing, and indeed there are few surprises in the movie once we understand the direction the story is taking. But Spacek is such a good actress, so well grounded in the particular traits of her characters, that it doesn't matter if she has played this sort of role before, because she does it so well this time.</p><p>She is helped, too, by the direction of <a href=#>Roger Donaldson</a>, the New Zealander whose little-seen "<a href=#>Smash Palace</a>" is one of the best movies ever made about the tensions surrounding an unhappy marriage, and the pressures it puts on children. Some of the same situations happen in the course of this story.</p><p>What happens to Marie is that she breaks out of one marriage to find herself in another situation where a man wants to call all the shots. The second man is Eddie Sisk, the governor's special assistant, whose job is to casually arrange special understandings and favors without involving the governor directly. Sisk is the man who gets Marie her job, and he is eventually the one who threatens to take it away. Sisk is played by <a href=#>Jeff Daniels</a>, who was Debra Winger's husband in "<a href=#>Terms of Endearment</a>," and again this time he projects an uncanny combination of smooth charm and concealed deceptiveness.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46mmKuhlWKubsDRrpxmq6Skv7p5kHJvbg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./holland-roden.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Holland Roden Is Now Single Woman Following Her Two BreakUps</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./fans-ship-jacob-ifan-and-olivia-cooke-as-dating-rumors-make-rounds-480745-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fans Ship Jacob Ifan and Olivia Cooke As Dating Rumors Make Rounds</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Lauren Miller Rogen movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-are-the-twin-sisters-who-swapped-identities-after-a-deadly-amish-buggy-crash.html>Who are the twin sisters who swapped identities after a deadly Amish buggy crash?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-confirmed-doctor-who-spin-off-shows-currently-in-production.html>All confirmed Doctor Who spin-off shows currently in production</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ice-beam-move.html>Ice Beam (move) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kirsten-rosenberg-oliver-tree-girlfriend-relation.html>Is Kirsten Rosenberg, Oliver Tree Girlfriend?
