His tattoo has sparked interest among his admirers, with some attempting to fathom its meaning.</span></p><p><span>The professional mixed martial artist (MMA) Josh Emmett currently competes for the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) in the featherweight division. Emmett wrestled for 14 years, beginning in elementary school and ending in college.</span></p><p><span>Emmett has been a professional fighter since 2011. He has also competed in King of the Cage, and as of March 21, 2022, he is rated No. 7 in the UFC featherweight rankings. Moreover, Emmett is also an accomplished Brazilian jiu-jitsu grappler, having won a world championship in the no-gi blue belt division.</span></p><h2 id=how-many-tattoos-does-josh-emmett-have><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-many-tattoos-does-josh-emmett-have></span>How Many Tattoos Does Josh Emmett Have?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>People who know Josh know he is a tattoo fanatic, and he would eventually tattoo his whole sleeve. Looking at his pictures, it is evident that he has numerous tattoos on his body.</span></p><p><span>However, he has not specified exactly how many tattoos he has made. Judging by the pictures, the fighter has tattoos on his right chest, and his right arm is half-filled with colorful tattoos.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Additionally, he has a Japanese letter symbol on his left chest right above his heart. He has a huge human skull with a world tour written in capslock covering his left-hand bicep. Moreover, there is a whole paragraph written that covers the whole left part of his ribs.</span></p><p><span>On his left and right side of the back, he has outlines of scary-looking clowns, similar to the character in the IT movie, Pennywise.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Last, he has a small tattoo on both sides of his wrists, a V symbol, and round-shaped dynamite. Interestingly, he has not tatted on the lower part of his body. He has declared that he wants to cover his arms with tattoos. Thus, people will be seeing more of his body getting covered in the coming years.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 id=meaning-and-design-of-the-tattoos-explained><span class=ez-toc-section id=meaning-and-design-of-the-tattoos-explained></span>Meaning And Design Of The Tattoos Explained<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>He had the urge to get tattoos because he is a huge lover of Japanese art, and Bill Liberty, one of the top tattoo artists in the country, has been around forever and happened to reside nearby.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>On his right bicep, he has a colorful tattoo of a tiki mask, a picture from the Big Island. The other joining pieces are cherry blossom flower, lotus flower, and water. He started this piece when he was nineteen.</span></p><p><span>He likes clown fish, the orange fish from the movie Finding Nemo, although he made the tattoo before the movie came out, and he even mentioned it was not Nemo and that it was brighter fifteen years ago. However, there is no information on other tattoos and their meanings.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 id=josh-emmetts-net-worth><span class=ez-toc-section id=josh-emmetts-net-worth></span>Josh Emmett’s Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>The professional UFC fighter had not disclosed his net worth to the general public. He has been a part of the UFC for almost eleven years.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>During his time in the ring, he has won several matches and has amassed huge prize money for his victory. Thus, the fighter must have earned an abundant wealth in his career.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJyfmsButs6sn2adnaKytcCMoZivnV2WerWt062mqGWdmq6vtc2gZJqmlGKxpr%2FIoKVmnailuaK1zZ6baA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./classic-tom-hanks-comedy-reportedly-remade.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>A Classic Tom Hanks Movie Is Reportedly Getting A Remake</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cody-rhodes-has-returned-to-wwe-after-a-torn-pec-surgery.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Cody Rhodes Has Returned To WWE After A Torn Pec Surgery</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cast-and-crew.html>Lauren Miller Rogen movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-are-the-twin-sisters-who-swapped-identities-after-a-deadly-amish-buggy-crash.html>Who are the twin sisters who swapped identities after a deadly Amish buggy crash?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./all-confirmed-doctor-who-spin-off-shows-currently-in-production.html>All confirmed Doctor Who spin-off shows currently in production</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ice-beam-move.html>Ice Beam (move) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kirsten-rosenberg-oliver-tree-girlfriend-relation.html>Is Kirsten Rosenberg, Oliver Tree Girlfriend?
