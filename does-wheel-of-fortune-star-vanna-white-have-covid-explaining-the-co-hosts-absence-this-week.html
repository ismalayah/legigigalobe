Because multiple episodes are filmed in a single day — five, to be exact — White’s absence on July 27 resulted in her being gone the entire Teacher’s Week.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=155 data-current-count=155 data-injectable=false>Wheel of Fortune mainstay and current co-host Pat Sajak addressed White’s absence at the top of Monday’s episode, confirming COVID as the reason.&nbsp;</p><p>“You’ll notice Vanna is not here, and I have to say that Ms. White has tested positive for COVID. That’s the bad news,” he explained. “The good news is I talked to her just a little while ago and she feels fine. She has a little sniffle. But she tested positive and that’s the way it goes, so she will not be with us here this week.”</p><p data-characters=466 data-current-count=466 data-injectable=true>Sajak assuaged any worries of serious medical complications, saying White was fine and that she only had mild symptoms. Viewers can expect White to return for the week of Oct. 9 through 13, although those episodes were actually taped prior to Teacher’s Week, on July 21. The next consecutive taping took place on Aug. 10, giving White plenty of time to recover; those episodes feature the “Bed & Breakfast” theme and will air from Oct. 16 to Oct. 20.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=274 data-current-count=274 data-injectable=false>Season 41 of Wheel of Fortune will be Sajak’s last before his successor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ryan Seacrest takes over as co-host</a>. White will see Seacrest through the first two years of his time on the game show, as her contract was renewed and finally includes her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">first pay raise in 18 years</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2SxsLHSZq6hnZWherCyjJ%2Bmq6ylo7Juv9OaqWaukaO7onnWoaCtnV2drrexjJymr6GUYrK5vMuaoKehnpx6tbTEZpqoZZikwLW%2FjJqZrJ2emLJuwMeiqmavlZq4cA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./luis-saldana-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-113131-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Luis Saldana Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./danny-pudi-is-married-to-wife-bridget-showalter-kids-532885-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Danny Pudi is Married to Wife: Bridget Showalter.
