It shocked to see Gore land a job in general as he ran back who has struggled to find any room to run over the last few years. His 3.77 yards per carry with the Colts over the last three years apparently spoke to the Dolphins, who are in a complete rebuild. The signing makes little sense, so don’t be surprised if the Dolphins add another running back in a talented draft class.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=frank-gore-colts></span>Frank Gore Colts<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>It’s confirmed by Indianapolis Colts honchos that veteran running back Frank Gore will not return to the team in 2018.newly christened Colts coach Frank Reich confirmed to the reporters that Chris Ballard and Frank did have a discussion once the season was over.Gore’s exodus leaves Marlon Mack, Matt Jones, Robert Turbin and Josh Ferguson in the Colts’ RB shed.<br>Gore played out his three-year of $12 million deal with the Colts at a consistent clip. Gore tallied 260, 263 and 261 rushes in his three seasons in Indianapolis, averaging more than 60 rushing yards per game and over 1,200 scrimmage yards in each campaign as well. Gore ranks fifth all-time in NFL history with 14,026 rushing yards – 75 yards behind Curtis Martin and 1,243 yards short of Barry Sanders. NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Thursday the Browns and Ravens are potential suitors for Gore.</p><p>Despite the disappointing seasons, The Inconvenient Truth left a mark and never let up.

Head Coach Adam Gase said at the NFL meetings in Orlando that many people look at Gore’s age but his physicality,pad level and ability is fit.Gore and Gase once crossed paths in 2008 during Gase’s one season as an assistant on the San Francisco 49ers coaching staff.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=frank-gore-49ers></span>Frank Gore 49ers<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Gore joinig 49ers changed everything.His attitude basically was, We don’t give a F about anyone.
