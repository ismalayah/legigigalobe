The 1984 classic sees a young boy saved from drowning by a mermaid, only for them to fall in love 20 years later when she seeks him out.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=368 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/splash-desktop-wallpaper.jpg alt=Splash width=2552 height=1442 sizes="(max-width: 2552px) 100vw, 2552px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=466 data-current-count=834 data-injectable=true>One of the best rom-coms of the 1980s, Hanks and Hannah generated some serious chemistry in the light-hearted romp, and Splash still holds a strong Rotten Tomatoes score of 91%. A remake was first announced to be in the works in early 2016 with a gender-flipped twist <a href=# rel=noopener>that would have seen Channing Tatum as the mermaid and Jillian Bell</a> as the human love interest, but there’s been no word on the project for over two years, leading many to believe it was dead.</p><p data-characters=679 data-current-count=679 data-injectable=false>However, a new report now claims that it’s back in development, although there’s no news on whether or not Tatum and Bell will still be involved. The former was also set to produce through his Free Association banner, but there was little in the way of additional talent attached besides the two leads, with the exception of Brian Grazer and original director Ron Howard as producers. <a href=# rel=noopener>Of course, fans were furious when Disney Plus censored Hannah’s butt for the movie’s streaming release</a>, but that’s the only time <strong>Splash</strong> has made headlines recently and it seems we’ll have to wait a bit longer before we hear something official on this remake.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomqWZo6i2pHnTqKRmoJGjuLR5wqiknpypYr%2BmvM6rq56cnK56s7HMmpueZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./banshee-review-evil-evil-season-2-episode-8.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Banshee Review: Evil For Evil (Season 2, Episode 8)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./does-josh-emmett-have-a-tattoo-meaning-and-design-explained.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Does Josh Emmett Have A Tattoo?
